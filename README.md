# 🌱 ML & Data Science Beginner Projects

Welcome to my journey into **Data Science and Machine Learning**!  
This repository contains hands-on explorations, mini-projects, model building, and data analysis using Python’s most popular libraries. Everything is structured, beginner-friendly, and fully explained.

## 🔍 Projects Overview

### ✅ 1. Numpy
- Practiced array creation, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.

### ✅ 2. Pandas
- Explored data loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and merging operations.

### ✅ 3. Iris Classification (10 ML Models)
A full ML workflow using the classic **Iris dataset**:

- **Dataset shape:** 150 rows × 4 features
- **Goal:** Predict flower species based on measurements

## 📊 Visuals & Outputs

- Confusion matrices, PCA projections, and tree diagrams are saved in `iris/outputs/`
- Model predictions are saved as CSVs
- Accuracy scores are saved as `.txt` files

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This repo is not just about running models — it’s about **understanding how each model works**:

- ✅ Visualizing decision boundaries & trees
- ✅ Understanding `.fit()` and `.predict()` behind the scenes
- ✅ Saving & reloading models
- ✅ Comparing models using accuracy and confusion matrices
