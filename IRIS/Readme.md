# üå∏ Machine Learning on the Iris Dataset ‚Äì 10 Model Comparison Project

This project applies **10 different machine learning models** on the classic **Iris dataset** to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.  
The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of various models and understand how they work under the hood.

---

## üìå Objective

- Predict the species of an Iris flower using its **sepal** and **petal** features.
- Implement and evaluate **10 different ML models**.
- Save models, predictions, visualizations, and performance metrics.
- Visualize all model accuracies in a comparison chart.
- Build a strong foundation for future deployment (API + React UI).

Each model includes:
- Training on 80% of the dataset
- Prediction and accuracy evaluation on 20%
- Accuracy saved to `outputs/Accuracy/`
- Model saved to `models/` folder
- Visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, PCA, decision boundary) saved to `outputs/`
